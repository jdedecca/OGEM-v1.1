## Synopsis

The Offshore Grid exploratory model (OGEM) simulates power transmission expansion for an offshore supergrid. Its main case study is the offshore grid in the Northern seas of Europe. The current approach is myopic optimization (i.e. with a restricted time horizon for the optimization problem).

## Motivation

The OGEM is part of the undergoing Ph.D. research of João Gorenstein Dedecca on an economic and governance framework for the Northern Seas offshore grid (http://homepage.tudelft.nl/w67e1/).
